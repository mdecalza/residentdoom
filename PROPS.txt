## ===========================================================================
## If you want to add more executables, create a set of properties ending in
## the executable name. For example, if you want to add an executable called
## "chocodoom", you would define the following properties:
##
## doommake.run.exe.chocodoom
## doommake.run.exe.workdir.chocodoom
## doommake.run.switch.iwad.chocodoom
## doommake.run.switch.file.chocodoom
## doommake.run.switch.deh.chocodoom
##
## And then you would run it by typing:
## doommake run chocodoom
