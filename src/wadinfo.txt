Description             : After a terrible car accident, you find yourself in a
                          spooky mansion looking for help...

                          A single map for DOOM II that plays fairly differently
                          to your average Doom adventure. This plays more like a
                          survival horror, with self-resurrecting enemies,
                          limited ammo, and an emphasis on puzzle solving and
                          secret hunting.

                          Happy Halloween!
